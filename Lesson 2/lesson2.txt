Lesson 2 Exercises - Compoennets and Props
Recommended: Create a copy of react-basics.html and to these Exercises.

2a. Create an <App> compoennet that returns a paragraph with the text: "Hello, welcome to my website" inside.
Then, render this <App>

2b. Continuing from 2a, in the <App> compoennet, add 2 buttons after the paragraph: "Login" and "Sign up"
- use fragment to group them together
- use () to write the JSX on multiple lines

2c. Continuing from 2b., in the <App> compoennet, add 2 text boxes above the buttons with the placeholders "Email" and "Password".
- Lay out the textboxes on separate lines using <div>
- Try adding the attribute type="password" to the password textbox. This will cover up the text as you type.

2d.  Continuing from 2c, create a new compoenent called Login Form, and move the textboxes and buttons (all the login - related code) into this compoenent. 
Then, isnide <App>, use <LoginForm> to create tje textboxes and buttons.

Challenge Exercises
Note: for these next exercises, start again with an empty React website.
2e. Let's say we're creting an e-commerce app, and one of the prooducts is socks. Create an <App> component and display the details on the 
right onto the website:

2f. Display 2 more products on the website: tennis balls and a t-shirt. Instead of duplicating the code, create a <ProductDetails> compoennet, and use props to
make it reusable. Then, display 3 <ProductDetails> on the website for the socks, tennis balls and t-shirt.

2g. Continuing from 2f, some products can have a discpunt. Add a prop to <ProductDetails> called discountPrice. If discountPrice exists, display it under
the original price. 
- Give the socks product a discount price of $5.45

2h. If a product has a discountPrice also cross out the original price.
- To cross out text, surround it with the element: <del> ... </del>
- Don't cross out the original price if there's no discount. To check if dicpuntPrice does not exist, use !discountPrice
- There are several ways to do this exercise. As long as you get the final result, you're good! 

2i. JavaScript has a feature called the ternary operator:
const result = value1? value2 = value3;

if value1 is true, then the result is value2. Else, the result is value3. 
- This lets us insert an if-else statement directly in the JSX
- Update the previous exercise to use a ternary operator in the JSX

2j. We'll add an image at the top of each Product. In your browser, go to supersimple.dev/images/ (replace with cotton-socks.png, tennis-balls.png, 
and plain-t-shirt .png). Download the images. 
- In <ProductDetails> add an <img> at the top, and add a prop called imageSrc. Give the <img> the attribute src={imageSrc} (this sets the src attribute 
to the value of the imageSrc prop). 
- Then in <App>, give each <ProductDetails> a prop imageSrc="____" (replace ____ with the file name of the image, like cotton-socks.png)
